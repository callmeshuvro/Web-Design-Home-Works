  <p><span>M</span>ount Everest, also known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan, is the highest peak on Earth. It stands majestically in the Himalayas, straddling the border between Nepal and China (Tibet Autonomous Region). At an impressive elevation of 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level, conquering Everest has been a lifelong dream for many mountaineers.

    The journey to the summit is treacherous and requires immense physical endurance, mental fortitude, and technical climbing skills. The Khumbu Icefall, the Lhotse Face, and the Hillary Step are some of the challenging sections that climbers must navigate. Despite the risks, reaching the top of Everest offers unparalleled views of the surrounding peaks, glaciers, and the vast expanse of the Himalayan range.
    
    The first successful ascent of Everest was achieved by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa from Nepal, on May 29, 1953. Since then, thousands of climbers have attempted to reach the summit, with varying degrees of success. However, the mountain remains an awe-inspiring symbol of human determination and the indomitable spirit of adventure.</p>
